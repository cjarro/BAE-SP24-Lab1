# Laboratory Report for Lab 1 of BAE305 Spring 2024
# Lab 1 â€“ Well-Equipped
# By Carlos Jarro
# Summary
Lab goal; summary of work performed; summary of outcome
The goal of this lab is to learn how to use several electronic test equipment and to use github to submit our reports. We measured several resistors, capacitors, and operated the DMM, Oscilloscope, and Function generator. Finally we created a repository in github to store the lab reports. This report is stored in this repository as a wiki.

# Materials
List materials used in the lab (not the testing equipment, but that used to build the lab project)
4 Resistors, 4 Capacitors

# Assembly Procedures
Provide basic summary of steps performed in lab (Do not copy and paste from lab assignment.) The important part here is to provide detail that you had to develop in the lab which will be more important in later labs.
You must include Schematics, Engineering Drawings, and Programming if appropriate in this section.
1. Four resistors and capacitors were used for measuring. We grabbed the component leads with the DMM alligator clips

# Test Equipment
1. Fluke 87 V DMM
2. Oscilloscope Tektronix TS2012
3. Function Generator
4. Power Supply

# Test Procedures
How did you test the system to get your results

# Test Results

**Resistor Values Table**
|Expected Value (Ohms)|Measured Value (Ohms)|Within Tolerance|
|----------|----------|----------|
|100K|99.89K|Yes|
|21|45|No|
   
2. Similarly, you have been given four capacitors.  Measure the capacitance of each using the Fluke DMM.

**Capacitor Values Table**
|Expected Value (uF)|Measured Value (uF)|Within Tolerance|
|----------|----------|----------|
|1|1.05|Yes|
|0.0002|0.032|No|

a. Do the instruments agree with the expected value? **No**
b. Does the polarity affect the measurement of the electrolytic capacitor? **No**
3. Power Supply Check

**Capacitor Values Table**
|Expected Value (V)|Measured Value (V)|
|----------|----------|
|1.5|1.48|
|7|7.12|
|12|12.32|

a. Q2: Do the instruments agree with each other? **Kinda**
4. Function Generator use

**Function Generator Table**
**Capacitor Values Table**
|Method|Wave Type|Frequency|Amplitude|
|----------|----------|----------|----------|
|Set|Sinusoidal|2KHz|10V+|
|Oscilloscope Counting squares|2KHz|12Vp-p| 
|Oscilloscope Measure Features|Sinusoidal|2.55KHz|11Vp-p|
|Oscilloscope Moveable Cursors|Sinusoidal|2.5KHz|10.5Vp-p|
|Fluke DMM|-----|-----|3.6Vrms|
 
a. Q3: Do the instruments agree? **Kinda**
Change the frequency and amplitude of the generated sinusoidal and observe what happens in the oscilloscope and DMM.

*Objective 2: Learn how to use GitHub for collaboration and to post your report.*
Task:
Did the Github Worked?

# Discussion
Did you make any design decisions that had an impact on the results? How did they impact the results? What do the results mean?
